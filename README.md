# hash-map-furniture
Project 4 for Data Structures

Instantiate the FurnitureBusiness class. Create three fully populated but different
customers. Create five different furniture objects; at least one of each type. The first
customer buys three furniture by calling the purchase(..) method of the
FurnitureBusiness object. The second and third customer each buy one furniture piece.
Now, use a for loop to iterate over all three customers. Use a nested for loop to iterate
over the five furniture pieces. In each iteration, call the hasBought(..) method of the
FurnitureBusiness object and print out customer, furniture, and hasBought status.
Iterate over each customer again and print out the furniture he has bought by calling the
getPurchases(..) method. Also, print out the total money a customer has spent using the
moneySpent(..) method.
